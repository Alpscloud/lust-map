	<p>At number 2 in our rankings is the cosmopolitan German city of Cologne ('KÃ¶ln') which is world famous for its impressive annual carnival dating back to the Middle Ages and its stunning 13th century cathedral, one of the largest in Germany. Cologne is also one of the most liberal areas in Germany, maybe even the world, and it is easy to fall in love with this charming city with its own distinct way of life. In no city in our ranking are there more annual LGBTQI events than in Cologne with an impressive 26 events each year. The city also has a thriving LGBTQI scene year-round. Whilst sometimes overlooked in favour of the more well-known cities of Berlin and Hamburg, this city on the Rhine is a true role model of liberalism, openness and individualism, especially in the sexual sense. Cologne residents are very proud of their liberal culture and are happy to welcome like-minded visitors sharing their values. It is unsurprising then that many international residents, including a number of celebrities, have set up home here.</p>

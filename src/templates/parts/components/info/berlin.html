	<p>When you think of some of the most sexually liberal and relaxed cities in the world, Berlin definitely springs to mind. Numerous world-famous techno clubs are located there, including the "world capital of Techno” Berghain, or Watergate. In Berlin, there has always been a huge LGBTQI+ scene and at least 49 gay bars, the 3rd highest number of all cities listed in the rankings (after New York City and San Francisco). There are 15 annual LGBTQI events in Berlin, the second highest number in our ranking (after fellow German city Cologne with 23), and events regularly attract a high number of international guests. Social openness is particularly pronounced in Berlin, with a very open BDSM and fetish scene present in the city and the annual "Venus" erotic fair – one of the largest of its kind in the world – also takes place here. In addition, prostitution is completely legal in the city and sexual minorities are protected by anti-discrimination laws. Taking all of this into account, it isn’t hard to see why Berlin takes 3rd place in our rankings!</p>
